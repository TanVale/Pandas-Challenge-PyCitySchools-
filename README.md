# PyCitySchools-Challenge
In this challenge I have analyzed the data from two csv files to create a report. 
The report consists of two data frames that I created 
      1. District Summary and 2. School Summary 
From the created data frames I have analyzed and produced the following results -
      1. Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
      2. Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
      3. Math Scores by Grade
      4. Reading Scores by Grade
      5. Scores by School Spending
      6. Scores by School Size
      7. Scores by School Type

  From the analysis I have drawn that 
      - The top 5 highest performing schools were charter schools and the top 5 bottom performing schools were district schools
      - Charter type school have higher averages compared to district type schools
      - Higher school spending did not necessarily mean the students performed better
